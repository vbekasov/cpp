## Description

Welcome to my project. 

Aim of this project is to show my knowledge in Computer Science. You will see how do I use modern C++ technologies, Python and Shell scripts to solve the Binary Tree problems and analyze its performance.

## Project Files

This project contained files:

* bin_tree.h  : header file with with Binary Tree class and support functions in
		namebi - namespace binary tree

* main.cpp : C++ file with main function generating and printing binary tree

* comp.sh : Shell script compiling C++ sources
	
* gen_rand.py : Python3 script generating set of random unique integers

* check_dup.sh : Shell script running binary with random integers

## Problem Description

Binary Tree is a kind of graph, and definition you can find on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Definitions). I wanted to show how I had solved this problem using
C++20. You will find algorithm analysis and visualization using Python and SQLite3 as well.

My algorithm uses unsorted set of integers as input, sort them and convert it to the tree. But during tree generation the program makes some duplicates. You can find more information about that step [here](#set-to-tree).

## Set to Tree

Input and tree generation.
