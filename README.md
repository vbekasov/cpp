# cpp

Welcome to my C++ project. 

Aim of this project is to show my knowledge in Computer Science. You will see how do I use modern C++ technologies, Python and Shell scripts to solve the Binary Tree problem and analyze its performance.

This project contained files:
	* bin_tree.h  : header file with with Binary Tree class and support functions in
		namebi - namespace binary tree

	* main.cpp    : C++ file with main function generating and printing binary tree

	* comp.sh     : Shell script compiling C++ sources
	
	* gen_rand.py : Python3 script generating set of random unique integers
