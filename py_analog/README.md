# Python Analog

Representation of LL and BT in Python3.

## Files

* [LL Module](m_ll.py)
* [BT Module](m_ll.py)
* [Implementation](py_lab.ipynb)

## Aim of Content

Here we can see the realization of LL on Python3. Python can grab and return any type of data (object/instance).

## LL Methonds
Public methods:
* <i>__init__</i> : constructor with first element initialisation.
* <i>push_back(self, input)</i> : add element at the end of the list.
* <i>push_forword(self, input)</i> : add element at the begining of the list.
* <i>print_ll(self)</i> : print LL
* <i>ll_length(self)</i> : return length of the LL
## Python vs C++

Python had used additional RAM and drive space, which dramatically increased time complexity.<br><br>
Data racing will be implemented further.
